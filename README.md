# Project: Recipes
__Description:__ A simple recipe website to practice my HTML knowledge. To add to the challenge, the web pages will be semantically structured. Once done, the web pages will then be validated through the HTML validation tools below.

## HTML Validation Tools  
* [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri)
* [FreeFormartter.com | HTML Validator - Linter](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html)

__How To Validate__  
1. Click on one of the links above.
2. Once on the website, and to start validating, you may validate by URI, uploading the `.html` file, or directly pasting the HTML code base to the text field.
3. Click on _"Check"_ or _"Validate HTML"_ button then wait for the result.
