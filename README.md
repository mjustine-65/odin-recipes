__Description:__ A simple HTML project about food recipes I'm interested in. Through this project, I will demonstrate how I structure web pages, and the files, and validate them through an HTML validator to ensure that they are within the current standards.

## HTML Validation Tools  
* [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri)
* [FreeFormartter.com | HTML Validator - Linter](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html)

__How To Validate__  
1. Click on one of the links above.
2. Once on the website, and to start validating, you may validate by URI, uploading the `.html` file, or directly pasting the HTML code base to the text field.
3. Click on _"Check"_ or _"Validate HTML"_ button then wait for the result.
