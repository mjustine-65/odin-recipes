        <h2 class="h2">Description</h2>
        <p>
          No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to
          the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a
          perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't
          get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do
          it perfectly.

        <h3 class="h3">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>- 1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
          <li>- &half; cup olive oil</li>
          <li>- 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
          <li>- &frac14; teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
          <li>- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
          <li>- &frac14; cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
          <li>- 1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="h3">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
            spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked
            through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and
            transfer to a pasta bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a
            cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10
            minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble.
            Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes.
            Remove from heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour
            in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and
            half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
          </li>
        </ol>
